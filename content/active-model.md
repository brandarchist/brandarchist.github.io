## The Active Involvement Plan

The Active Model is where I plug directly into your company—like a cultural co-founder you didn’t know you needed.

---

### 🧭 What I Actually Do

- Own the hiring pipeline  
- Identify, advocate for, and train high-EQ juniors  
- Create team structures that scale (without middle managers)  
- Translate founder vision into team execution  
- Resolve tension and cultural drift *before* it becomes attrition

> *You get a full-time energy, part-time footprint, zero overhead.*

---

### 🔁 Weekly Flow

- 16 hours/week  
- Distributed across short syncs, async feedback, and team interventions  
- Designed to feel like I’m “always around” while still giving your team space to breathe

### ✨ Why It Works

Most startups stretch their best engineer into a part-time manager.  
Then they wonder why features stall, morale drops, and hiring turns into guesswork.

I *take that burden away* so your team can focus, flow, and thrive.
