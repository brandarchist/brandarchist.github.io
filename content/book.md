## Let’s Talk

If you’re an early-stage founder and want to avoid culture collapse, hire smarter, or just figure out what your team *actually* needs—I’ve got you.

**No cost. No commitment. Just 30 minutes of signal.**

### Why Book?

- You’re hiring and want a second brain
- Your team has unspoken tension and you’re not sure why
- You’re scaling and don’t want to lose the soul of your company
- You’ve got great engineers, but something feels off
- You just want to sanity check your next big move

---

### How It Works

- Calls are held via Zoom or Google Meet  
- You talk, I listen (and ask the right questions)  
- If we vibe, we’ll talk about what working together might look like

This is how I work best:  
No pressure, no pitch decks, no “business development” nonsense.  
Just a real convo with someone who sees culture like code.
