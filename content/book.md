## 🗓️ Let’s Talk

If you’re an early-stage founder and want to avoid culture collapse, hire smarter, or just figure out what your team *actually* needs—I’ve got you.

**No cost. No commitment. Just 30 minutes of signal.**

## 🎯 How It Works

- 💻 Calls are held via Zoom or Google Meet  
- 🧠 You talk, I listen (and ask the right questions)  
- 🤝 If we vibe, we’ll talk about what working together might look like

This is how I work best:  
No pressure, no pitch decks, no “business development” nonsense.  
Just a real convo with someone who sees culture like code.
