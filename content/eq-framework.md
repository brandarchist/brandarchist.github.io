## Culture Backed by Science

This isn’t guesswork or vibes. My approach is grounded in proven frameworks like:

---

### 🌀 Spiral Dynamics  
> Understand the operating system behind every personality on your team.

- Know who’s ready to lead  
- Spot who’s running fear scripts  
- Build rituals that match your team’s maturity level

---

### 🧬 AQAL (Integral Theory)  
> Evaluate performance across multiple dimensions: behavior, mindset, relationships, systems.

- High performers aren’t always loud  
- Some rockstars thrive with the right context  
- You need a framework to *see the whole person*

---

### 🔍 Peer-Based Review & EQ Metrics  
> We measure what matters—alignment, self-awareness, team resonance.

- Less HR. More real-time cultural feedback.  
- No-bullshit performance filters  
- Psychological safety without babysitting

---

> *The result? A team that works harder, stays longer, and attracts the kind of talent that keeps your startup from turning into a resume graveyard.*
