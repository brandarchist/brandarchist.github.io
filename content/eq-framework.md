## Emotional Intelligence Isn’t a Buzzword. It’s a Weapon.

Startups that collapse early don’t do it because their product sucks.  
They do it because their people don’t communicate, don’t trust, or burn out fast.

That’s not a hiring problem. That’s a culture problem.

## 🌀 Spiral Dynamics Meets Startup Reality

I use Spiral Dynamics and AQAL theory to build teams that work *because* they understand each other. Not just their roles—but how they process, collaborate, and recover from stress.

Most orgs stay stuck in:
- **Blue**: rigid, rule-following, top-down pressure
- **Orange**: hyper-competitive, ego-driven, burnout factory

I aim for:
- **Green**: human-first, emotionally aware
- **Yellow**: systems-aware, autonomy-respecting, founder-aligned

## 🧠 My Peer Review System

Forget corporate feedback forms. I built a proprietary system that doesn’t just ask people to “rate their teammates.”

It maps:
- **How you show up to others**
- **Where your blind spots are**
- **How your emotional presence impacts team velocity**

Not everyone wants this level of clarity. But high-performance teams *need it.*
