## Simple, Honest Pricing

Every service is a $5K block.  
No sliding scale. No hourly drama. Just results.

---

## ðŸ§² Passive Cultural Support â€” $5K/month  
**~1 day/week (8 hours)**

Ideal for early teams who need a culture co-pilot but arenâ€™t ready for full-on leadership.

- Culture coaching
- Candidate screening + phone screens
- 1-on-1s to raise individual and team EQ
- Spot burnout early, boost retention, and lay the cultural foundation right

---

## ðŸ§  Active Cultural Leadership â€” $10K/month  
**~2 days/week (16 hours)**

You get me as a full team lead, without burning one of your best engineers on people problems.

- I take ownership of hiring, mentoring, and execution alignment
- I help junior talent grow fast while protecting your senior bandwidth
- I bridge founder vision with team delivery, so over-promises donâ€™t happen
- Feels like you hired a Head of Culture with tech fluency and zero ego

---

## ðŸ‘‘ Leadership-Only Model â€” $5K/month  
**~1 day/week (8 hours)**

If you just want me to lead your team and skip the culture layerâ€”no problem.

- I integrate as a leadership layer with no politics, no fluff
- Ideal when you already have a strong cultural foundation but need bandwidth
- Engineering fluency from DevOps to architecture
- Clear direction, strong delivery, zero hand-holding

---

## ðŸ›¬ On-Site Immersion â€” $5K flat

Use your weekly hours for a visit instead. Iâ€™ll embed on-site for a full day (or two half-days), plus host a cultural event if youâ€™d like.

- Real-time syncs, team health-checks, and bonding
- Optional team dinner, karaoke, or escape room
- No extra travel costs, no bullshit receiptsâ€”just pick a date
