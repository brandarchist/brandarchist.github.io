title: "From Overlooked Junior to Indispensable Engineer"

## 🚀 The Situation

A fast-growing startup needed to fill a technical gap—quickly.  
The team was short on senior talent, and timelines were tight.  

Their original plan? Hire someone with a “safe” resume.  
My call? *Take a chance on the hungry kid who lives on GitHub.*

---

## 🎯 What I Did

I overrode the default hiring logic.

- I **personally screened** a junior candidate most of the team had passed on
- I identified high **adaptive potential** and strong pattern recognition
- I convinced leadership to take the bet—*with my mentorship baked in*

Once hired, I:
- Structured a **tight feedback loop** between them and the team lead
- Assigned stretch goals with **weekly 1:1s focused on acceleration**
- Advocated for **temporary slack** so they could explore + level up fast

---

## 🧠 The Outcome

Within **3 months**, they were delivering at mid-level.  
Within **6 months**, they became *the* person everyone leaned on.  
By year’s end, they were training new hires and **owning core systems**.

The best part? Their loyalty never wavered—because someone believed in them early.

---

### 💡 Takeaway

Not every hire needs to be “ready.”  
Sometimes, all they need is **the right system** and someone who actually sees them.
