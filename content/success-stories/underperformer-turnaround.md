## 🩹 The Situation

A developer was flailing.

They were missing deadlines, freezing in reviews, and struggling to contribute anything meaningful.  
Leadership was ready to cut them loose.

But I saw something else.

---

## 🎯 What I Did

I looked beyond their Git commits.

- Dug into their **learning style, communication patterns, and feedback loops**
- Identified that they were being **micromanaged and mis-assigned**
- Pulled them into a different team—one with **a clear process and a calmer lead**

Then I:
- Set micro-goals to rebuild confidence
- Created a **private praise loop** to anchor progress
- Made sure they got **wins** early and often

---

## 🔥 The Outcome

Inside 2 months:
- Their commits tripled
- Their review approvals went from hesitant to **rubber-stamped**
- They became the go-to for internal tooling and dev efficiency

The team stopped asking “why are they still here?”  
And started asking “what would we do without them?”

### 💡 Takeaway

People don’t fail in a vacuum.  
Put someone in the right environment—with the right feedback—and they’ll show you exactly why they were hired in the first place.

> Got someone on the edge? They might just be your next MVP.
