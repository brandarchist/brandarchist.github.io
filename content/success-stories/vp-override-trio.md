title: "The VP Override That Became a Power Trio"

## 🧠 The Situation

A mid-stage startup was hiring for a core backend role.  
The team had a favorite. I had a better option.  
The catch? *Almost everyone else had already passed on my guy.*

---

## 🎯 What I Did

I went straight to the VP and made my case.

- Showed how this candidate **processed complexity faster** than others
- Flagged high social cohesion and **team-building potential**
- Told the VP: *“If you trust me on this one, you’ll get a multiplier effect.”*

He overrode the team.

They hired him.

## 🤯 The Outcome

Within 4 weeks, this guy:
- Delivered more than the favored candidate could have
- Introduced two **insanely sharp engineer friends** from a past project
- Pulled them both into the company—and they were **hired instantly**

The three of them ended up owning major parts of the infrastructure and becoming the **highest-leverage team** in the company.

---

### 💡 Takeaway

Sometimes the best hire isn’t the most obvious one.  
Sometimes, it’s the one who unlocks **two more just like them**.
